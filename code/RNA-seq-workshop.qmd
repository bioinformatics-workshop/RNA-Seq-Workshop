## What is RNA-seq? {.smaller}

RNA sequencing or **RNA-seq** is one of many method used for gene expression studies by obtaining a snapshot of the RNA molecules within a biological system. 

The method involves the sequencing of complementary DNA (cDNA) within a population of cells.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies include:

-   Short-read based (e.g. Illumina)

-   Long-read based (e.g., PacBio, Oxford Nanopore)

## Transcriptome profiling methods

[Table Highlighting various transcriptomic methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2484/tables/1)

-   cDNA or EST sequencing
-   Microarrays
-   RNA-seq


## Transcriptome profiling resolution

-   Bulk tissue (bulk RNA-seq)
-   Laser-capture microdissection (LCM + RNA-seq)
-   Single-cell (scRNA-seq)
-   Spatial transcriptomics (spatial scRNA-seq)
